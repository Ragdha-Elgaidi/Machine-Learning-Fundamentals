# Deep Learning as a Subfield of AI and ML
- As we can see, Artificial Intelligence is the overarching field and includes algorithms like Local Search and Logic Programming. Machine Learning is a part of Artificial Intelligence and includes models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that consists of various neural network models.
- Three nested circles. The outer circle is labeled "Artificial Intelligence" and contains the text "Encompasses the way computers 'think'". The middle circle is labeled "Machine Learning" and contains the text "Relies on data to make decisions". The inner-most circle is labeled "Deep Learning" and contains the text "Leverages neural networks to learn from data".
