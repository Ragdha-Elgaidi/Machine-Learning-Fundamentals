# History of Deep Learning
## AI Winter and AI Spring

- The origins of Deep Learning stem from the perceptron, a probabilistic model of the brain developed in a 1958 paper by Frank Rosenblatt based on the McCulloch-Pitts neuron.

- A later book by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert exposed the imitations of the model and, coupled with a number of other unrealized applications, ended neural network research for nearly a generation.

- In 1998, the successes of neural networks on handwritten digit recognition restored confidence in the research program, and by 2012, neural networks became the de facto standard for doing computer vision.
