# When To Use Deep Learning
- Deciding when Deep Learning is the Right Tool
- Deep Learning is a powerful tool, but it's not the only one. In general, the way to choose whether or not to use Deep Learning depends on your task, what kind of data you have, and how complex the relationships in the data are.

- Scenarios in which to use Deep Learning include but are not limited to:
