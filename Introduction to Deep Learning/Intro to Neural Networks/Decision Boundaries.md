# Decision Boundaries
## Nonlinear and High Dimensional Decision Boundaries
- Our data will dictate what the shape of our decision boundary should be.
-  Neural networks will be able to find decision boundaries that are high-dimensional and nonlinear by combining the decision boundaries of the hidden neurons.
-   Even in cases where we cannot visualize our decision boundary easily, knowing the approximate complexity of our decision boundary will inform how big our model needs to be.
