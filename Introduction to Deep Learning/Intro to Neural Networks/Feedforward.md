# Feedforward
- Training a neural network essentially means determining what parameters they should have on the edges in order to model our data well. So in order to learn how to train them, we need to look carefully at how they process the input to obtain an output.

 # Error Function
 For a multilayer perceptron, as we saw, our prediction is simply a combination of matrix multiplications and sigmoid functions. But the error function can be the exact same formula, aside from the fact that y^y^â€‹ is a bit more complicated.
