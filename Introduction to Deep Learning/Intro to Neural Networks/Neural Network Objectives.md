# Neural Network Objectives
## Adjusting your Model According to Objectives

- Once you know the output you're aiming for -- a binary classification, a classification into multiple classes, or a real number -- you can use that information to make decisions about your model.

- In particular, the combination of loss function and output activation function is dictated by the type of problem that you have.
