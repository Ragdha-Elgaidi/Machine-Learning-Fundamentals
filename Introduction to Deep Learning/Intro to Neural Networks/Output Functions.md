# Output Functions
## How to Choose an Output Function

- Your choice of output function depends on two primary factors about what you are trying to predict: its shape and its range.
 - This means that our output function is determined by what we're trying to do: classification or regression.

- Common output functions include:
   - Sigmoid for binary classification
   - Softmax for multi-class classification
   - Identity or ReLU for regression
