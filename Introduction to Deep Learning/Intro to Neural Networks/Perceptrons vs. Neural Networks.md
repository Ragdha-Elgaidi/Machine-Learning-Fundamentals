# Perceptrons vs. Neural Networks
- Multilayer Perceptrons are Neural Networks
- The perceptron and neural networks are inspired by biological neurons. Though modern "perceptrons" use the Logistic Sigmoid Function or other activation functions, classical perceptrons use a step function.
- Neural Networks are a more general class of models that encapsulates multi-layer perceptrons. Neural Networks are defined by having one or more hidden layers and an output layer that emits a decision -- either a predicted value, a probability, or a vector of probabilities, depending on the task.
