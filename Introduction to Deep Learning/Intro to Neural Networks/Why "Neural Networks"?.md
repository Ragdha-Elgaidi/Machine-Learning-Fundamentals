# Why "Neural Networks"?
- Neural Networks get their name from the fact that they are—loosely—modeled after biological neurons. Perceptrons take inputs, perform calculations on the inputs, and decide whether to return one result or another (e.g., a one or a zero).
- In a similar way, neurons in the brain receive inputs (such as signals from other neurons) through their branching dendrites, and then decide whether to, in turn, send out a signal of their own.
- Similar to how real neurons can be connected one to another to form layers, we will be concatenating our perceptrons—layering multiple perceptrons such that we can take the output from one and use it as the input for another.
