# How Do Experts Think About Algorithms and Tools?
n the past, organizations used their machine learning tools as a hidden advantage. This is no longer the case, as many have now released their tools to the public. In doing so, they have found that the data which is used for these tools, is worth far more than the tool themselves.

The benefit of having tools that are open to the public is that they can be built and improved on by collaborators. These collaborators may not even be part of your organization. Their contribution not only improves the tool but diversifies the use cases for which it can be used. Finally, when the tools are widely adopted, hiring new talent who are already familiar with the tools can be a competitive advantage.
