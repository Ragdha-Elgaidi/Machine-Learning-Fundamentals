# Sagemaker Jumpstart
- Sagemaker Jumpstart has prebuilt solutions for many well-defined problems.
-  These solutions offer 1-Click deployments which manage the entire ML process.
-   Another way to look at it, is they control the entire workflow of the ML lifecycle.
-   They also provide pre-trained models, that can be used directly or fine-tuned on your data
-    Lastly, Jumpstart provides algorithms to integrate into your problem, which can be scaled easily with Sagemaker, and give you the power to control training and deployments.
