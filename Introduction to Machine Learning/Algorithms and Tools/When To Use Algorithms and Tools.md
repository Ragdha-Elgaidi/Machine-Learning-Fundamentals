# When To Use Algorithms and Tools
- Examples of when to use the following tools:
## Linear Models
- Linear models are well known, and usually the first model type practitioners use for new problems. It's a great way to create a baseline model to which all future models can be compared to.
## Random Forests
- Random forests, a tree-based model, are very robust. It provides a good solution to throw data at in order to see what kind of model is created. When compared to XGBoost, the available parameters are less complicated, making it a better choice when first starting on new data.
## XGBoost
- XGBoost is very powerful, often so powerful that it's hard to tune in order to achieve optimal performance. With enough experience in how to tune its parameters efficiently, it can be a default option to apply to problems.
## AutoGluon
- AutoGluon is the new era in prototyping a model for new problems. It intelligently tries different models and parameters automatically. It allows you to quickly iterate on new data and get future ideas to optimize a model.
## Sagemaker Jumpstart
- Sagemaker Jumpstart provides solutions to typical problems in a nontechnical way. And since Sagemaker is a complete infrastructure surrounding the cloud ML space, Jumpstart is a great option when maintaining the entire ML lifecycle internally.
