# Data Wrangler
- a cloud-based solution for exploratory data analysis and data transformations on AWS.
- Helps with extract, transfer, and load (ETL) pipelines.
- S3 is your object store. Data Wrangler uses S3 to import data into its application in order for it to process it. You'll need to have a bucket, which one should be created for you already.
