# How Do Experts Think About Exploratory Data Analysis?
- Exploratory data analysis is probably the first thing that experts think about when encountering new data. EDA is often included in publicly available datasets and includes calculated characteristics of the size, features, and target value. This gives practitioners an idea of what they will be working with and facilitate how they approach building a model.
 
## Before looking at a new dataset, what question should you ask yourself before starting EDA?
- what the size of the data, what the target value and what kind of features are there and what problem I have to solve.
