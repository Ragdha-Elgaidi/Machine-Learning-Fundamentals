# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
- set of tools and processes that allow you to understand data better. This includes creating summary statistics, identifying outliers, and visualizing feature distributions.

- With machine learning as a whole, EDA is the foundational layer. Together with data engineering, modeling, and inference, it creates the ML pyramid. EDA is the foundational layer because, without it, the rest of the ML workflow will not be successful. EDA provides an understanding and insight into the data that can be directly fed into data engineering.
