# Business Stakeholders
-    Executives - they create the KPIs for their business to succeed.
 -   Product managers (PMs) - work with engineers and users of their platform to improve the overall product.
-    Engineers - main stakeholders of the product. They design and build the product that machine learning will integrate with.
-    Data scientists (DS) - owners of the data that powers machine learning. They often provide insights or initial models that will need to be integrated into the main product.
