# Brief Timeline of Machine Learning

-    1943 - Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts created a model for neural networks.
-    1950 - Alan Turing published a paper called "Computing Machinery and Intelligence".
-    1959 - Arthur Samuel popularized the phrase machine learning.
-    1965 - Alexey Ivakhnenko and fellow researchers created the first working deep learning networks.
-    1970 - 1980 - ID3 and DART decision tree algorithms were created.
-    1998 - Yann LeCun created the stochastic gradient descent algorithm
-    2011 - Alex Krizhevsky created the AlexNet neural network
-    Present day - GPUs and TPUs power a larger portion of machine learning. Large option of frameworks and libraries for ML.
