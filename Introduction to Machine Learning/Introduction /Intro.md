- Machine learning progressed from the desire to first calculate math problems. Before technology, all calculations were done manually by hand. This required a large number of individuals to work together to compute complex equations and other various tasks.

- When computers were invented, they provided a way to shift how we work, from calculating problems to working on higher-level concepts. The result was our ability to ask harder questions, requiring more information to answer them.

- Eventually, we started to teach computers, that with enough data, and the right set of instructions, they can engineer their own instructions. With these instructions, typically called algorithms, machines could answer complex questions that were unobservable to humans.
