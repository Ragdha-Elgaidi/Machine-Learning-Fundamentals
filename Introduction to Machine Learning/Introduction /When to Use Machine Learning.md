# When to Use Machine Learning
### Define Problem
- Without a clear definition of what you are trying to solve, it is difficult to build a machine learning model.
### Measurable Outcome
- Machine learning is built around learning objectives. Objectives need some way of showing that the model is learning, which is where metrics come into play.
### Not Simple Solution
- Simple solutions can often be built using traditional engineering. Machine learning's performance really proves itself when used on complex problems that individuals find difficult to complete.
### Feasibility
- If aspects of the machine learning problem are completely impossible, there is no sense in spending time and research for a solution. Working with business stakeholders will assist in proving the reality of a successful outcome.
