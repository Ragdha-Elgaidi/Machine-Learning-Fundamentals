## Domain
Defines the industry or field you are applying your knowledge. This includes what is the question you are looking to answer. Also referred to as scope. Domains may also involve problem types such as image-related problems or text understanding.
## Data
Complete data, which contains all the necessary information for your models.
Incomplete data, which in this case could be missing, badly labeled, or just incorrect.
## Model
The modes of a model are supervised and unsupervised. Model is directly linked to the domain and data. How domain and data are constructed directly alters how the model will function.
