# How Do Experts Think About Machine Learning Concepts?
## Does using ML succeed in accomplishing my task?
- If you do not build the correct model, you will be unable to provide a solution to customers.
## How does the ML system work together with those who use the decisions from the model?
- This is important because it may highlight some process that was missed when building the ML system. Knowing how the model is used is just as important as building the model itself.
