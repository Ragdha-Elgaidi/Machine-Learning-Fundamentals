# When To Use Machine Learning
- These concepts are always important because they are another foundational piece to the machine learning knowledge base.
   - When using the ML lifecycle, the structure helps the business understand how models interact and function within the wider application.
   - These algorithms and fundamentals help extend into advanced ML topics, including deep learning, where the core ideas are also highly relevant.
   - When starting with simple ML algorithms, it provides a baseline metric on which you can later gauge future work.
   - Because machine learning concepts often entail simpler models, it allows them to be more transparent and easier to debug. Simpler often means easier to implement and easier to understand.
   - Simpler models also provide faster training and inference, which leads to a more performant model that may benefit the end-user of the model.
