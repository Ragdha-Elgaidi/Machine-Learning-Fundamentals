# Glossary
  -  One-hot encoding - transforming a column of categorical data into many columns of binary values associated with the categories.
  -  Deep learning embedding - a vector of numerical values representing some input value. Similar input values will have similar embeddings. Used in text, images, and videos to represent highly dimensional data into small dimensions.
 -   Null values - values that are missing in a dataset. Represented as None or NaN.
 -   R2 - measures the proportion of variance.
 -   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) - Measures standard deviation of prediction errors.
 -   Residuals - Differences between true target values and predicted values.
 -   Accuracy - total correctly predicted by the total number of values.
 -   Precision - the number of true positives by the number of true and false positives.
 -   Recall - the number of true positives by the number of true positives and false negatives.
 -   F1 - harmonic mean of the precision and recall. Used with unbalanced datasets.
 -   Hyperparameters - model's configuration parameters which modify how the model functions.
 -   Grid Search - searches hyperparameters in a deterministic fashion across all options available for a model.
  -  Randomized search - randomly selects hyperparameters across all options available for a model.
 -   Bayesian search - uses statistical methods to optimally select hyperparamters across available options for a model.
